# A dockerized duplicate image finder by philipbl

Original project [here](https://github.com/philipbl/duplicate-images). Since it needs a DB its perfect for packaging for docker to make it a bit more convenient.

## Quickstart
```
git clone https://github.com/yannhowe/docker-duplicate-images.git
docker-compose up
```
